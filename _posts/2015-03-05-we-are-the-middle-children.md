We are the middle children. Too late to explore the continents of Earth, too early to explore space.  


I do not understand your sorrow.  

My friend, we stand upon the backs of explorers whose sacrifices nurture us. We hold in our hands the keys to the garden of space in which the infinite spring of adventure pours. The fountain of youth is not one where old men go to stave off death's embrace, but it is where we send our children and their children so that they may live.

Brother, we are the Gatekeepers, the Architects, the Creators, the Bridgemen. It is our age that connects one era to another, one explorer to the next. We are not explorers, we were never really meant to be. Our children are the ones who will touch the intangible, ride asteroids around the stars; when they wake up, it will be stardust they scrape from their eyes.  

Sister, our children cannot come into their own if we do not come into ours. Do not mourn a destiny that was never yours. We must make for them their future through our own sacrifices.

If you must, chug your alcohol and go to bed, but please be ready in the morning - we have work to do.
