Found this on [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/263rpg/people_keep_telling_me_to_read_how_to_make_friend/chnfw4d?context=3) And decided to keep it close.


How to Win Friends and Influence People was the result of Dale Carnegie's (no relation to Andrew Carnegie) struggles to find adequate materials to supplement his adult education courses on self-improvement and public speaking. Carnegie saw a need for a book that would thoroughly address the topic of how to interact with others in order to get them to like you and get what you want. He developed the book over a long period of time (10-15 years?) with extensive research (he hired a full-time researcher to help him for several years).

The first chapter is on criticism. The main idea: don't give it. Carnegie argues that the only reactions people will have to criticism are defensiveness, justification, and offense. He presents as evidence several notorious criminals from the era who, when asked, were adamant that they had done no wrong. He also briefly refers to Abraham Lincoln, who was apparently a staunch advocate of this philosophy. While the idea is clearly oversimplified, it is an interesting one. Criticism is probably more often used as a salve for the criticizer's emotions than as a true tool for improvement. It is clear that there are many interpersonal benefits to be gained from abstaining from criticism. The challenge that remains is how to effect improvement if not through criticism. The book blithely offers up positive reinforcement, but that can't be the full answer.

Chapter 2 starts off by arguing that one of the main motivators of any person is the desire to be important. An interesting premise. However, the line quickly diverges to come back in parallel with the first chapter: just as criticizing is bad, praising is good. Carnegie encourages the reader to be generous and thoughtful with their praise. By offering praise for things done well, the recipient of the praise will be motivated and become better at everything. There is a lot of truth in this idea, but I'm not convinced that it full addresses the gap in the first chapter: how do you effect directed improvement?

Chapter 3 is all about offering people what they want. The idea: the vast majority of people attempt to convince others by talking about what they themselves want; they would be greatly benefited by taking the viewpoint of those they are trying to convince. The advice seems straightforward enough and, honestly, this chapter didn't connect with me as much as the previous two did. I would like to think that I already do a pretty decent job of this. Perhaps this chapter can be used as a formal step in a formula, ensuring that I don't forget it when I am trying to make a concerted effort to convince someone of something.

The fourth chapter begins the section on how to get people to like you. The first principle is to become interested in other people. By taking an interest in their interests and talking about them, you are generally flattering them (sincerely) by making them feel important. The book gives several anecdotes of individuals who have made themselves "interesting" to others not by talking about themselves, but really just by listening intently.

The message of the fifth chapter is simple and powerful: smile more. Smiling just makes people like you better. You are more approachable and give the impression that you like the person better. It makes them more likely to want to associate with you and talk with you. It has the added benefit of making you feel better as well.

The sixth chapter is about remembering and using an acquaintance's name. The idea is that simply by remembering their name and using it in conversation you are making the person like you better both consciously and unconsciously. In the near-term, dropping their name into conversation makes them feel a closer connection with you. Over time (especially a long time), people appreciate it when you remember their names, particularly if they do not expect you to.

Chapters 7 through 9 all cover the same topic, continued from chapter 4: take an interest in people. Talk about their interests. Talk about them. Make them feel important. Encourage them to talk about themselves. The idea is that people love to talk about themselves and are only looking for an excuse. The book gives numerous anecdotes of people who have gotten what they wanted not by talking about that subject, but simply by showing an interest in the person who has what they want.

Chapter 10 begins the third section: how to convince and influence people. The first chapter states plainly that the best way to win an argument is by avoiding it in the first place. Arguments lead to negative emotions/associations and defensiveness. Even if you achieve the superficial satisfaction of being right, you have made an enemy (of sorts) and thereby lost. I think that the book oversimplifies the issue a bit, but the point is still a good one. I could definitely afford to fight fewer fights. I think I've done a good job on this front, but there's more work to do. So what if somebody says something wrong? It's unlikely that my correcting them or arguing with them will actually win me any points in the long run.

The eleventh chapter says to never directly disagree with someone. Even if you think they're wrong (or know they're wrong), there is little to be gained from telling them as much. At the very least your language should be tempered: modest and self-effacing to disarm the other individual. Once the other is comfortable with you, they will be more open to listening to you and your slight suggestions of the reality of the situation.

The twelfth chapter urges the reader to readily admit when they are wrong. Of all of the chapters so far, I think that this is the one that I already have the best grasp of. I may not be a wholly objective commentator on the subject, but I'd at least like to think that I am very ready to admit when I'm wrong. No need to convince me of the desirability of the tendency.

The thirteenth chapter is about being friendly. This really just seems like a rehash of previous content. Don't criticize people. Praise them lavishly. Smile. Don't argue. Perhaps the chapter serves as a synthesis or reminder of the earlier chapters?

The fourteenth chapter is based on the idea of getting someone to start out a conversation be being agreeable. Actually, the chapter is explicitly about getting them to say "yes" over and over. I don't actually agree with the chapter as laid out; the approach feels disingenuous and I feel leads to more defensiveness and hostility. I was struggling to pen down exactly why until Carnegie compares the method to Socrates at the end. That then reminded me of my dissatisfaction with The Republic. In that classic work, Plato seeks to convince people by leading them through a train of logic that they are "forced" to agree with at every point. My issue with that method--and the one from this book--is that it ignores the fact that there will almost always be a step that must be taken that is not entirely logical. At that point, the person is going to take their pent up defensiveness and frustration at your condescending approach and tell you that you're an idiot. Still, I think the idea of the chapter has merit in another form. If you can get on the good side of someone and get them in the mindset of agreeing with you, then they'll be more likely to be agreeable when you get to something contentious.

The sixteenth chapter is about influencing people by getting them to think that your idea is their own. I actually think that this is a really great concept that I could develop a little bit more. Of course, the concept as presented in the book isn't a new idea to me, but that doesn't make it any less valid.

The seventeenth chapter encourages the reader to make a genuine effort to think see things from others' point of view. This seems like pretty sound advice to me and I like to think that I already do a good job at this. I'm not sure though. I think it bears some more reflection to figure out if I'm doing a good job at this or just think that I am. One interesting tidbit from the chapter is the proposition that if you were in another person's shoes (had their parents, their upbringing, their experiences) then you would do exactly as they do. While it's impossible to argue with the proposition as stated, I'm not sure how insightful it really is. Just interesting.

The eighteenth chapter suggests to appeal to a person's nobler motives to influence them. This sounds right on the face, but I'm not sure that I really get it. Even the book doesn't really seem sure. This is one of the few places that it admits that the tactic will not work in all situations or for all people. Still, I think there's a deeper tactic hiding under the surface. If you can stir a sense of nobility in someone then you have a much better chance of making things happen. It may not be in the superficial way that the book suggests, but it bears a little more thought.

Chapter 19 proposes that you should dramatize your ideas to get them across better. I don't really believe in the idea as stated: it seems unnecessary and annoying in most circumstances. Still, it can be a useful trick in a select few cases (a big kickoff/report-out for instance). I think the broader point that is a little more apt is that it pays to be creative if you're trying to influence someone. Don't just tell them or show them a chart. Figure out a way of sharing the information that will be engaging.

Chapter 20, the final chapter in this section, says that when all else fails in influencing someone, then challenge them. The idea is that people will rise to a challenge. Even in the workplace--the book says--the primary motivating factor isn't the pay but the content and challenge of the work itself. There's a lot of truth in this concept, but I think the real difficulty comes in the execution. How do you get somebody in the competitive spirit in a productive way? This will require some more thought...
