I'm reposting [this answer](https://www.quora.com/Should-an-economist-learn-programming/answer/Dvid-Silva?__snids__=660865219&__nsrc__=2) I left in quora recently, it seems worth sharing. 


Apart from the idea that everyone should learn programming economists can benefit greatly.


As an economist managing data is an important part of your work I suppose, looking at charts, curves, trends; without programming skills your capacity will be very limited, either manually doing calculations and formulas to obtain and analyze this information or using the tools available in your computer, like excel bar charts.


Programming is being able to give instructions to a machine, a computer in this case; is a beautiful thing, seeing the inert code go from your text editor to some magic application, obedient and fast. 


With code you can increase multiply by a huge factor the amount of work or calculations you can perform, read millions of rows of data, try and find patterns or relations, compare oil prices to Reddit traffic, or the natality rate to the average interest earned by investors in Wyoming;  whatever you can think of in a matter of minutes or hours and unleash your imagination. 


Also, to the case of anyone should learn code, if you can code companies will like you more than if you can't, so you will up the other people that are applying to that position.
