this guys were not even american and now everyone's saying that all developers are like that; when we certainly aren't. If there are not more girls involved in this if because they aren't not because guys are dicks and are keeping them outside, every woman entrepreneur or developer will always find a lot of support and appreciation from its colleagues, we love to see woman doing great stuff, but complaining and pretending to be a victim is not gonna take you anywhere you want.

You know what deems girls bad, female founders and their use of cleavage to attract visits to their stand, or marketing girls with super mini skirts. I understand truck companies and oil change sites use them but they look completely out of place in tech events.
