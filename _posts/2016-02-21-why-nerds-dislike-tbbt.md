I'm going to jump out on a limb, and give you an honest, non-glib answer as to why I feel that BBT gets a lot of hate within "nerd communities".  I don't necessarily agree with all of it, but here's a few reasons why I think it gets as much hate as it does.

!).  BBT makes nerd culture the butt of, not the subject of the jokes:


South Park's Make Love not Warcraft episode managed to make WoW the *subject* of their jokes.  Community's D&D episode managed to make D&D the *subject* of their jokes.  Are they both poking fun at a lot of the elements in these things?  Absolutely, but that's just it.  They're making fun of parts of it, like the guy who gets way too into roleplay, getting killed by a bad dice roll, the neckbeard that plays WoW 20 hours a day.  In BBT, nerd culture itself is the joke.  I remember one episode where Sheldon said he was playing N64 on an emulator, and the laugh track played.  I was expecting that to be the setup to the joke, but it wasn't.  That was the joke, the idea that someone would want to play an N64 game on a computer was the punchline.

2) Exploitative humor:

Alright, let's not beat around the bush here.  Butthurt is an inherent, and important part of nerd culture.  Some off us got off easy just being "weird kids", and some of us got beaten up daily, but very few people who were deeply entrenched in typically "nerdy" things had smooth sailing in our younger years, and that, unfortunately, breeds a lot of bitterness.  I think a lot of people having grown up under that kind of a weight resent seeing the culture they were mocked for adopting being played for a joke.  It wasn't funny when they got their nose bloodied because they read books during lunch.  No one played it as an affable, comedic, good-hearted moment when someone slung their Magic cards off the table and laughed while they picked them up.  So, I think a lot of people see this being played out as a comedy being marketed to the demographics that once mocked nerds as being somewhat of an affront, an opening of old wounds. 


3) The Uncanny Valley:

Maybe using the term [uncanny valley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley) is a bit of a stretch.  Perhaps "close, but no cigar" would fit better.  In any case, this is another reason why I think "nerds" largely reject BBT; it is a close approximation of nerd culture, but its not quite an accurate representation.  When people see the [GUI interface in Visual Basic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkDD03yeLnU), or the [Hacker Typer](http://hackertyper.com/) representation of security in other shows, they're willing to laugh it off.  Its bad, but its so bad that people laugh rather than rage.  The problem with BBT is that we really *DO* play N64 games on an emulator, but we would be using a USB controller to play, not the keyboard.  We really *DO* have gaming machines that we built, but they wouldn't be an Alienware.  We *DO* keep a whiteboard in our apartment for ideas, but its not a competition between us.  BBT catches flack because its not far enough off the mark to write off, but its not close enough to identify with.




**tl;dr**: BBT catches shit because it treats nerds, and nerd culture as being a laughable set of stereotypes, when many people feel that its an important cultural part of their life.  It reads like blackface for nerds.
