Found this on [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/25xwbn/eli5how_does_a_group_like_the_illuminati_who_were/), decided to share:

I apologize for the length, but you've opened up a can of worms with this question. 

Describing the historical Illuminati as just "a group of free thinkers" is a bit misleading. The order was essentially geared towards a strict regime of moral education, which involved writing monthly confessionals (the "quibus licet" reports) and spying on other members, as well as using the order's influences to get the supposedly morally superior initiates influential positions in order to *slowly* reform society to a utopian state where everyone would be so rational that any form of government would no longer be necessary. Adam Weishaupt, the founder, was heavily influenced by the writings of Antoine Court de Gébelin and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who were both really big on ideas like primitivism and the noble savage. At the same time, the order was also extremely deceptive, using a variety of myths (such as claiming to be descendants of the Knights Templar) to attract members and it also had a very radical required reading list. As members advanced in the order, they were expected to read scandalous literature like d'Holbach's *Christianity Unveiled*. 

Until the Bavarian government published *Einige Originalschriften des Illuminatenordens* and *Nachtrag von Weitern Originalschriften* in 1787, two large collections of confiscated order documents and really the main source of what we know about the order, the only real information on the Illuminati came from disgruntled defectors, especially the juridical deposits of Joseph Utzschneider and two of his colleagues, Cosandey and Grünberg. Utzschneider had defected in early 1783 after someone tried to coerce him to steal letters from the Duchess Marie Anne of Saxony, the former electress of Bavaria and an opponent of Hapsburg acquisition of Bavaria. To simplify an incredibly complex affair: Joseph II, the Holy Roman Emperor, wanted Bavaria; the Prince-Elector of Bavaria, Karl Theodor, wanted to trade off Bavaria; and Frederick the Great did not want Joseph II to get Bavaria. Joseph II had tried to take advantage of a succession dispute in 1777, when Karl Theodor had become the heir of Bavaria despite not really wanting it (he was already the Elector of the Palatinate), to achieve his goals but ended up losing a war against Frederick the Great instead. However, Joseph II had a new plan in 1783, which a majority within the Munich branch of the Illuminati supported, and Marie Anne had written to Frederick the Great to help put a stop to it. The letters Utzschneider were asked to steal were from Frederick the Great. So there was a clear political element in the suppression, and it's not surprising that the juridical deposit left by Utzschneider et al. says stuff like:

>They also boast that they are in possession of the secret of opening and reclosing letters without the circumstance being perceived. 

and

>The end sanctifies the means. The welfare of the Order will be a justification for calumnies, poisonings, assassinations, perjuries, treasons, rebellions; in short, for all that the prejudices of men lead them to call crimes. 

as well as

>They made us give answers in writing to the following questions: How would it be possible to devise one single system of morals and one common Government for all Europe, and what means should be employed to effectuate it?

The first two are complete crock, of course, but I imagine that the third quote is a misinterpretation (if it did happen).  In *The Genesis of German Conservatism*, Klaus Epstein mentions that the equally incorrect idea that the superiors in the order had the "power of life and death" over their subordinates was very widespread.  It did not help that the authorities found a recipe for poison during a search of Xavier Zwack's house in 1786. In addition, the suppression of the Illuminati was a comparatively limited affair. Even though there were edicts in Mainz and Bonn (coupled with an edict issued by Joseph II that tried to bring freemasonry closer under imperial control), Bavaria was the only territory I'm aware of where members were actually arrested. Johann Bode would, with the support of the ruling dukes of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg and Saxe-Weimar, continue to direct the order from either Weimar or Gotha (not entirely sure which, unfortunately) until its demise in either 1787 or 1788, but he would also help establish the *Philadelphe* circle while visiting Paris in 1787 as well as the *Deutsche Freimaurerbund* in 1790, which was for all intents and purposes an extension of the Illuminati. So conspiracy theorists had plenty to work with, even though Bode effectively purged all radical elements out of the Illuminati and seems to mainly have been interested in masonic reform.

The *Originalschriften*, which would be joined by the third volume *Die Neuesten Arbeiten des Spartacus und Philo in dem Illuminatenorden* in 1793 (consisting of documents stolen by a defector), the juridical deposits, and other documents were all used by Augustin Barruel to support the idea that the French Revolution had been engineered by the Illuminati in his 1797 *Memoires Illustrating the History of Jacobinism*. John Robison, a scottish professor, published *Proofs of a Conspiracy* the same year, which makes essentially the same argument as Barruel. To simplify a bit, Robison and Barruel both saw the Illuminati as anti-Christian attempts to destroy the natural order of things born out of the radical elements of the French Enlightenment. Their books were incredibly influential and pretty much delineated the conspiratorial interpretation of the Illuminati, later authors have reinterpreted this depending on their anxieties but the core is the same. Nesta Webster tacked on an anti-semitic element into the whole affair and saw the history of the Illuminati as beginning before 1776, the John Birch Society saw Weishaupt as the originator of the Communist Conspiracy, and so on. The idea of a "world domination" oriented Illuminati may, if you'll forgive me for speculating, have come during the Cold War period.

**tl;dr The Illuminati wanted Austrian acquisition of Bavaria. Bavarian loyalists defected and gave exaggerated testimony to demonize the order. House searches and confiscated documents seemed to support these claims, plus the continued existence of the Illuminati in Northern Germany was seen as evidence that they were still up to no good (despite it essentially being a masonic reform movement at this point). Robison and Barruel spun all of this into conspiratorial narratives about the french revolution, which later authors have interpreted depending on their own views.**

The excerpts from the juridical deposit are taken from Augustin Barruel's *Memoirs*, but I don't know the exact page number or volume. The whole depositcan be read [here](http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/2014/01/29/illuminati-conspiracy-part-one/), but the article is not as good as some of the author's later writing.

**EDIT:** Rewrote the concluding paragraph.

**EDIT #2:** To my critics, this is about as simple as you can get without vastly distorting the historical record. But I agree that it was a bad decision to not include a tl;dr, so I've rectified that.

**EDIT #3:** Thanks for the gold, kind strangers! I'll be sure to put in a good word for you when I return to JIDF headquarters  later to collect my paycheck (and yes, they do pay me by the word.)
