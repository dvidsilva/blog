I found this gem on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2ljl25/wp_an_atheist_is_sent_back_in_time_and_meets/clvj5ut), and I thought of sharing. Credits to [DreadandButter](https://www.reddit.com/user/DreadandButter). 

An atheist goes back in time and meets Jesus:


"Who are you?"

"I think that is the question I should be asking *you*" replied Jesus.  They were sitting on two stones by a riverbank.  The cool water flowed past them serenely, rolling over pebbles and clay.  Some songbirds tweeted in the distance.  There was a light breeze that washed over them.  It seemed surreal to the man who had come to meet the self-proclaimed messiah.

"If you are who, or rather, *what*, you say you are, then you must already know," replied the man.

"Even so, I'd still like to hear it from you."

The man sighed.  "I am Nathan Roberts.  I am a theoretical physicist from the 21st century.  And I've come back in time to investigate your existence."

Jesus said nothing.  His gaze was contemplative and ponderous.

The man was slightly thrown off.  "Well?"

"You've just told me what you are, but you've yet to tell me *who* you are" he responded calmly.

"You don't seemed surprise to hear that," the man said.

"You don't seem surprised to be telling me," Jesus replied.

"Are you a god, *the* God, or are you just a man?" the man asked curtly.

"First, I would like you to tell me who you are."

The man's brow furrowed slightly.  There was no telling how long he'd be able to stay when he was, and this "Jesus of Nazareth" was being difficult.  "What do you mean?"

"You let your title define you, but that's not all there is to you."

"The same could be said of yourself, Messiah."

Jesus smiled.  "Yes, I suppose that is true."

"So, who am I then?"

Jesus stared at him again.  No, not at him, into him.  "You're a man who's being forced to confront his convictions."

The man said nothing.

"You are a non-believer, are you not?"

"I am an atheist, yes."

"Again you let a title define you."

"How else should I define myself?"

"You shouldn't define yourself at all."

"But *you* defined yourself."

"I did."

"So why shouldn't I?"

"Because I am what I am.  I'm not more or less than that.  I have my purpose, and it is set."

The man was thrown off by his assertion.  "How can you possibly say that you are the son of God?  How can you make that claim?"

"Because I am."

"So what makes you and me different?" the man asked, impatiently.

"Because you aren't forced to make the same choices that I am.  Your destiny is malleable.  The choices you made have led you here, without your prior awareness.  I am here because I know to be here.  That's the difference.  I know.  You don't.  You can't possibly know how your decisions will affect your future.  I am cursed with knowing.  Knowing how I would be born.  Knowing who I would meet and when I would meet them.  Knowing when I would die.  And knowing what would come after my death.  How my truths would be tainted by tyrants who wield their fear like a weapon..."  

Jesus trailed off for a moment and his gaze strayed.  When he looked back at the man he was smiling again.

"And knowing that despite those men, good people would continue to live by my words without believing in me.  There is a great deal of beauty in your existence.  You control your destiny.  You make choices despite being faced with the unknown future.

"So to get back to my original point, you should not define yourself with words and titles.  When you do that, you confine yourself to act in a way that is expected of you.  You shut yourself out to a great deal of possibilities, simply because it's not something an 'atheist' or a 'theoretical physicist' would do.  So how should you define yourself?  You simply live life.  Your choices define you.  Your actions define you.  Your beliefs define you.  But no words can define you.  Use words to define things of concrete natures.  Nature, structures, societies..."

He paused for a moment.

"And gods."

The man was silent.  He let the words sink into him.  Finally he spoke.

"So since I met the son of God, does that mean I should become a Christian?"

Jesus laughed.  It was warm and comforting.  "Still missing the point.  I don't care what you call yourself.  You're a good man, Nathan Roberts.  A little impatient and selfish at times, but you've never hurt anyone intentionally.  No, I don't care what you call yourself."

At that moment a small alarm started sounding from the man's wristwatch.

"Jesus, there is still much I want to ask you.  There's still much I want to know."

Jesus nodded.  "I know."

"Can you keep me here a little longer?"

"I can."

"Will you?"

"Of course not, Nathan Roberts."

"Why not?"

"Because I've already told you enough to make you understand."

"Understand what?"

"You'll see in time."

"But Iâ€”"

---------------------------------------------------

The man awoke in the laboratory.  A group of scientists and historians crowded around him.  Immediately he was inundated by a wave of questions, too numerous to understand.

One scientist silenced the crowd.  "Give him a moment!  He's just returned from the past, for fuck's sake!"

The man nodded to the scientist.  He slowly sat up from the machine.

"Well?"

"Well, what?" the man responded.

"Did you see him?"

The man paused for a moment to think about what Jesus had said again.

"I did."

"What did he say?"

"Quite a bit."

"Who was he, then?"

He paused, then smiled.

"He was just a man.  A man who knew too much."

The crowd was perplexed by his answer and a new wave of queries began, but the man waved them off.  "I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Please, give me some time.  I've just been through an extraordinary ordeal and I need to contemplate what I've learned.  I promise I'll answer your questions soon.  Now, excuse me."

------------------------------------

Months later, the man was being interviewed by a journalist.  "The Man who met Christ".

The man sat in the chair and a microphone was pinned to his lapel.  Two glasses of water sat on a small endtable between himself and the other chair.  The interviewer sat down.  She said something to her producer, then informed the man that the interview would be beginning.  The man nodded.

The interviewer turned to face the man.  Lights came up and the camera started recording.

"So.  Who are you?"
