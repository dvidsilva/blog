Replied this recently to someone, thought of sharing:


I'll have to take the side of those that say hire someone, or at least if you're looking for a co founder offer him some extra money.

1. starting 50/50 leaves you in a bad position, if the guy is not so good or well intended you can get in trouble.

2. If you hire someone and he doesn't deliver you can get rid of him, getting rid of a co-founder that doesn't deliver is way harder.

4. If you don't offer the guy/girl/trans/monkey/dog money and he is in need he might ditch your project, or, god knows, he might not even have enough money for lunch for months and will have to work in other things, so is not sustainable, or will  take longer to develop.

8. Programmers, specially very good ones, tend to believe that they're job is like sacred and magical and the real (only) value in the company, approaching them with a proposal like this might only get you junior developers.

16. If you're hiring people, try also to understand the stack they will be using and their tools, the code, advantages, etc, so you don't get 'scammed'
