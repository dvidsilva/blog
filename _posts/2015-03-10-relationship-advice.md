When talking about [/r/theredpill](https://reddit.com/r/theredpill) I asked a girl about some good advice and she told me the [following](https://www.reddit.com/r/iamverysmart/comments/2yfnkz/theredpill_user_brags_about_knowing_basic_grammar/cpahk3q?context=3): 

Well... off the top of my head, I know this is going to sound strange, but he tries way too hard to please me and not always in smart ways.


For example, he usually won't tell me he disagrees with me, because he's reluctant to cause "conflict." But sometimes it's absolutely crucial to know exactly what your partner thinks - and the truth, too, not some sugar-coated version of it. And, in even more general terms, he usually tries to work out what is it that I "would like to hear," rather than what is it he wants to say. (Because he thinks his opinion is not as important as my satisfaction.) This is a very, very silly thing to do and a very wrong way to approach a relationship. In general, men seem to be quite fond of "tell her whatever just to shut her up" technique, and it amazes me, because it just doesn't work. Anyway, a man who can't even present his opinion or make up his mind and thinks that is an expression of love is not really very good relationship material. He's young (significantly younger than me) and I have hope for improvement, but every now and again I think of what will happen if I need some actual support, someone to discuss serious things with and he'll just sit there meekly and say "you're right, darling." If you feel like you're less important in a relationship, that your opinion doesn't matter or that its voicing can end the relationship, it's probably not a good idea to be in that relationship. Yet this can often be a result of no-confidence rather than actual relationship problems.
